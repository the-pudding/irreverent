Since when do I have neighbors?"},{"type":"text","value":"For me and my partner, one of the things we‚Äôve started to notice is that if you leave Netflix idle on your TV for long enough, a screensaver will start. It cycles through screenshots displaying shows and movies you can watch on the platform, each accompanied by a compelling image and three descriptive words."},{"type":"text","value":"For example, the talk of #quarantine2020, <i>Tiger King</i>, looked something like this."}],"preGraph":"The longer I watched titles flip by, the more I started to feel like I was seeing one descriptive word just far too much. Once I noticed it, I couldn‚Äôt stop. I was convinced that the 4 walls of my studio apartment were just getting to me, so I sat down and recorded all 43 advertised titles and their descriptive words. See if you notice a pattern:","postGraph":"My suspicions were confirmed. Out of those 43 shows, 11 (26%) of them were described as <span class=ir>irreverent</span>.

Had I been unwittingly causing my own <span class=ir>irreverent</span> doom?!"},{"type":"text","value":"So I created a brand new profile, provided it no preferences at all, and found the descriptive words that appeared alongside each hovered thumbnail when you visit Netflix on a computer (the same words that were appearing on my screensaver).

The show is described as <span class=ir>heartfelt</span>, <span class=ir>witty</span>, and <span class=ir>quirky</span>. I‚Äôm certainly not here to advocate that we should be using this word to describe <em>more</em> titles, but it seems like its use is inconsistent at best and misleading to viewers at worst."},{"type":"text","value":"I know that with everything going on in the world right now, the words Netflix uses to describe their titles probably feels like the least important thing. I‚Äôm not even about to argue with you about that. But as stay-at-home orders continue across the world, Netflix usage is booming. The global platform saw an astounding <a href=https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/netflix-adds-15-7-million-global-subscribers-amid-pandemic/ target=_blank>15.7 million new subscribers</a> in the past quarter, double what they had been anticipating.

According to <a href=https://theoutline.com/post/2559/netflix-synopses-writers?zd=1&zi=ysc2bn3v target=_blank>an investigation</a> from <i>The Outline</i> in 2017, this can be partially attributed to the fact that the synopsis writers were not paid ‚Äúwell enough...to actually watch the movies‚Äù. That was a few years and a different synopsis system ago, so I‚Äôm hopeful that things have changed at Netflix since then."},{"type":"text","value":"But still, it makes me wonder who is selecting these words and why <span class=ir>irreverent</span> is used so profusely. Are we assuming this word (which is technically a real genre of comedy) is well-understood by viewers? And I if this many shows are poking fun at ‚Äúthings generally taken seriously‚Äù, are those things actually taken seriously anymore? If this many things are <span class=ir>irreverent</span>, is anything?"}]}
