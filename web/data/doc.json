Since when do I have neighbors?"},{"type":"text","value":"For me and my partner, one of the things we‚Äôve started to notice is that if you leave Netflix idle on your TV for long enough, a screensaver will start. It cycles through screenshots displaying shows and movies you can watch on the platform, each accompanied by a compelling image and three descriptive words."},{"type":"text","value":"<i>Grey‚Äôs Anatomy</i> is apparently <span class=ex>soapy</span>, <span class=ex>emotional</span> & <span class=ex>dramatic</span>"},{"type":"text","value":"The talk of #quarantine2020, <i>Tiger King</i> is <span class=ex>riveting</span>, <span class=ex>provocative</span> & <span class=ex>investigative</span>"},{"type":"text","value":"The longer I watched titles flip by, the more I started to feel like I was seeing one descriptive word just far too much.

The show is described as <span class=ir>heartfelt</span>, <span class=ir>witty</span>, and <span class=ir>quirky</span>. I‚Äôm certainly not here to advocate that we should be using this word to describe <em>more</em> titles, but it seems like its use is inconsistent at best and misleading to viewers at worst."},{"type":"text","value":"I swear, I‚Äôm almost done complaining about a single word on a streaming platform that I use far too frequently. Just one last thought. If this many shows are poking fun at ‚Äúthings generally taken seriously‚Äù, are those things actually taken seriously anymore? If this many things are <span class=ir>irreverent</span>, is anything?"}]}
