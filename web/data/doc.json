A lot. And I started feeling like I was seeing ‚Äúirreverent‚Äù everywhere. I wanted to know if this was real or if it was the weeks of staring at the 4 walls of my studio apartment just getting to me.

I‚Äôm not even about to argue with you about that. But as stay-at-home orders continue across the world, Netflix usage is booming.
