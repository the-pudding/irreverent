I’m certainly not here to advocate that we should be using this word to describe <em>more</em> titles, but it seems like its use is inconsistent at best and misleading to viewers at worst."},{"type":"text","value":"I know that with everything going on in the world right now, the words Netflix uses to describe their titles probably feels like the least important thing. I’m not even about to argue with you about that. But as stay-at-home orders continue across the world, Netflix usage is booming. The global platform saw an astounding <a href=https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/netflix-adds-15-7-million-global-subscribers-amid-pandemic/ target=_blank>15.7 million new subscribers</a> in the past quarter, double what they had been anticipating.

According to <a href=https://theoutline.com/post/2559/netflix-synopses-writers?zd=1&zi=ysc2bn3v target=_blank>an investigation</a> from <i>The Outline</i> in 2017, this can be partially attributed to the fact that the synopsis writers were not paid “well enough...to actually watch the movies”.
