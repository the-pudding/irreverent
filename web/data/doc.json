We’ve been spending a lot of time together lately, but one of its quirks has started to get under my skin. If I leave the app idle on my TV, a screensaver starts advertising its titles paired with three descriptive words. It looks something like the illustration below. After watching it for a while, I noticed <strong>one, single, maddening word</strong> used more than the rest."}],"postTV":[{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Irreverent. Irreverent.

It’s certainly possible that I’ve been causing my own <strong>irreverent</strong> doom."},{"type":"text","value":"So, I created a brand new profile with no viewing preferences, which <a href=https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639 target=_blank>according to Netflix</a>, should display “a diverse and popular set of titles”.
