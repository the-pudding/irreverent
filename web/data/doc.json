{"author":"Amber Thomas","date":"<del>May</del> Quarantine 2020","intro":[{"type":"text","value":"Recently, <strong>my Netflix account and I have been spending a lot of time together</strong>. But one of its quirks has started to get under my skin. If I leave the app idle on my TV, a screensaver starts showing titles on the platform paired with three descriptive words. It looks something like the illustration below. After watching it for a while, I noticed <strong>one single, maddening word</strong> used more than the rest."}],"postTV":[{"type":"text","value":"<strong>Irreverent. Irreverent. Irreverent.</strong> C’mon Netflix, this is the word that dominates the descriptions of your shows? At least on my account, it was the most common tag, appearing alongside 26% of advertised titles."}],"preDef":"If, like me, you need a little refresher on the definition of irreverent, don’t feel bad. It’s the only one of the most common tags that’s an <a href=https://satvocabulary.us/ target=_blank>actual</a> <a href=https://www.vocabulary.com/lists/151263 target=_blank>SAT word</a>. Here’s the definition:","def":"<span class=def>Irreverent</span>: showing a lack of respect for people or things that are generally taken seriously","postComplaint":[{"type":"text","value":"Interestingly enough, this implies that <i>by definition</i> it shouldn’t be a common descriptor for media. Afterall, if everything is poking fun at things generally taken seriously, is anything taking them seriously? If everything is irreverent, is anything? Either way, I was starting to see the word irreverent in my dreams."},{"type":"text","value":"Now, I know what you’re going to say. Netflix’s <a href=https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639 target=_blank>algorithms</a> are probably surfacing things that it thinks I would like based on my own viewing preferences. It’s certainly possible that I’ve been causing my own <strong>irreverent</strong> doom."},{"type":"text","value":"So, I created a brand new profile with no viewing preferences, which <a href=https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639 target=_blank>according to Netflix</a>, should display “a diverse and popular set of titles”. Even with this new account, <strong>irreverent</strong> was the second most common tag."}],"commonTitle":"Most Common Words Used to Describe Titles on Netflix","commonSub":"Out of 141 titles shown to brand new profiles in April 2020","commonLegend":"= 2 titles","togetherTitle":"Titles Tagged <select></select> on Netflix","togetherSub":"Out of 141 titles shown to brand new profiles in April 2020","togetherLegend":"<span class=chosen>Irreverent</span> is paired with <span class=count>x</span> unique other words","prePairs":[{"type":"text","value":"That’s so much irreverence. What is going on here? Why is the word irreverent being used so much?"},{"type":"text","value":"Even though it irks me personally, there <i>may</i> be a reason for using this specific word: it’s what certain viewers want. In a 2012 interview with the Los Angeles Times, the overseer of Netflix’s tagging program, Todd Yellin, described the team’s process of choosing the word <strong>cerebral</strong> over the more-accessible <strong>brainy</strong>. He said “...we concluded that if you like cerebral titles, then ‘cerebral’ will be a good word for you”. Since, <strong>irreverent</strong> is a real genre of comedy, maybe its heavy use throughout Netflix is to specifically target users who know of and enjoy that specific sub-genre."},{"type":"text","value":"That may get at why irreverent is used instead of another descriptor (<a href=https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/irreverent?s=t target=_blank>Thesaurus.com</a> suggests the synonyms “cheeky”, “flippant”, or “tongue-in-cheek”), but it doesn’t explain why so many irreverent titles are being surfaced."},{"type":"text","value":"For that, we may be able to look to COVID-19. Sure, when stay-at-home orders first started rippling across the US, it seemed like everyone was watching <a href=https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/why-is-pandemic-entertainment-so-big-right-now/ target=_blank>movies about pandemics</a>. But <a href=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=pandemic%20movies,comedy%20movies,drama%20movies,action%20movies target=_blank>Google searches</a> for “comedy movies” also peaked around that same time. We can’t know for sure if users were looking for <strong>irreverent</strong> comedies, of course, but if there were ever a time to poke fun at things like our government, wealth, or the way we work… this may be it."},{"type":"text","value":"Even <a href=https://www.cbc.ca/comedy/why-watching-comedies-is-important-medicine-1.5519839 target=_blank>researchers agree</a> that watching comedies during times of uncertainty can have a “positive effect”. In an <a href=https://www.cbc.ca/comedy/why-watching-comedies-is-important-medicine-1.5519839 target=_blank>interview with CBC</a>, Dr. Shira Gabriel, an associate professor of psychology at SUNY, University at Buffalo explained that “it can be comforting to make light of the very things that worry us. It can make those things seem less scary and remind us that we are not alone.” Maybe Netflix is doing us a solid by putting these titles front and center, trying to give us a nudge to pick something light during these tough times. Or maybe they’re just letting us know that other users are rewatching <i>The Office</i> or <i>Schitt’s Creek</i> for the umpteenth time and you may want to finally give it a try."},{"type":"text","value":"Either way, if you’re looking for new titles that happen to be irreverent, explore all 141 titles and tags shown to my brand new profile below."}]}
